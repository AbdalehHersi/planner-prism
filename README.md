# planner-prism

<p>This week we were given some starter code to develop into a dynamically updated planner</p>
<p>The planner has simple 9am to 5pm timeblocks that green, red, white depending on if they're in the future present or past respectively. There is the current time displayed at the top and you can enter text and press save to save it into the local storage.</p>

THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future</li>
<li>WHEN the user clicks into a time block
THEN they can enter an event</li>
<li>WHEN the user clicks the save button for that time block
